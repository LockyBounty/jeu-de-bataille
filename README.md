# Bataille Card Game  instructions
## Game logic
1. This game of Bataille has only 10 cards going from 1 to 10
2. There is two players in the game (card game divided into two decks)
3. At each turn, both players can pick a random card from their OWN card deck
4. The cards are discarded when played in the game
5. The game ends when there is no more card in the game
6. The winner is the one who won the most turns


### purpose of the exercise:
##### part 1:  Pen and Paper
on a piece of paper: 
1. use English or French to divide the game process into different steps
2. Write in more details each steps using Pseudo Code, English or French (but no actual Code)
3. Read all the detailed steps again

##### part 2:  

Time to code ;)


## Bonus

To easy ? Well this time rather than having 10 cards, you have an actual card game  (four families of 13 cards)

1. Jack is 11
2. Queen is 12
3. King is 13

NB: What happen when both players play the same card ?

Have fun ;)
